## Database Schema

- **Users**: Stores user information (`user_id`, `name`, `email`, `phone_no`).
- **Teams**: Information on teams within the organization (`team_id`, `name`, `description`).
- **Tasks**: Tracks tasks (`task_id`, `title`, `description`, `status`, `due_date`, `assigned_to`, `oncall_team`, `completion_time`, `creation_time`).

### Indices:
- Date
- Status on Tasks

## Supported Queries:
- **Date**: Filter for overdue tasks (`date < current`, `status != completed`), filter for incomplete tasks before a certain date.
- **Status**: Filter for incomplete, pending, in-progress, and overdue tasks.

## Isolation Level: Read Committed

For a task management web app, **Read Committed isolation** is likely the best choice because:

- **Consistency**: It avoids dirty reads, ensuring that users always see committed, consistent data.
- **Performance**: It provides a good balance between consistency and performance.
- **Use Cases**: Your app may allow users to edit, assign, or update tasks, so you donâ€™t want them to read data that is in the process of being modified (which could happen with Read Uncommitted).
