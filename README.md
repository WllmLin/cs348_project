## Database Schema

- **Users**: Stores user information (`user_id`, `name`, `email`, `phone_no`).
- **Teams**: Information on teams within the organization (`team_id`, `name`, `description`).
- **Tasks**: Tracks tasks (`task_id`, `title`, `description`, `status`, `due_date`, `assigned_to`, `oncall_team`, `completion_time`, `creation_time`).

### Indices:
- Date
- Status on Tasks

## Supported Queries:
- **Date**: Filter for overdue tasks (`date < current`, `status != completed`), filter for incomplete tasks before a certain date.
- **Status**: Filter for incomplete, pending, in-progress, and overdue tasks.

## Isolation Level: Read Committed

For a task management web app, **Read Committed isolation** is likely the best choice because:

- **Consistency**: It avoids dirty reads, ensuring that users always see committed, consistent data.
- **Performance**: It provides a good balance between consistency and performance.
- **Use Cases**: Your app may allow users to edit, assign, or update tasks, so you donâ€™t want them to read data that is in the process of being modified (which could happen with Read Uncommitted).

## Lessons Learned:
- **Create a good database schema** at the beginning with thorough thought. It is hard to modify a database after production. Database migrations are very difficult.
- **Have flexible APIs** with multiple endpoints for different queries.

---

## Technologies Used:
- **Stored Procedures**: Used to filter for tasks before certain dates, and filter for overdue tasks using raw SQL.
- **Django API**: Provides ORM access to the database for easy data queries and CRUD actions. The Django API uses ORM to sanitize user input and ensure that no invalid data is written to the database. I also checked the input of date to make sure it was a valid date before performing orm querying.
